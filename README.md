## VisionOS sample app with Unity

This example project is to demonstrate building Unity VisionPro apps on AWS. Please refer to the blog (Japanese) for more details: [Apple Vision Pro向けUnityアプリをAWS上でビルドする](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/news/build-apple-vision-pro-unity-apps-on-aws/)

This project code is initialized by Unity's template for a VisionOS application, adding a [`Jenkinsfile`](./Jenkinsfile) to call a build job from Jenkins.
